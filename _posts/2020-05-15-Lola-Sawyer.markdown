# Gralola

Some people have asked me “What’s the point in selling granola?” “Are you even making money?” Throughout the process of making and selling graLola as a one person business I have learned more things than the money can make up for.

I am the only one who runs graLola, meaning I have all the roles of a business. Some of the roles are:

* Producing the granola
* Advertising to the public
* Keeping track of all the data
* Communication

I have sold over one hundred bags since quarantine started, made over five hundred dollars, and have over thirty customers.

When graLola started I was unsure what the outcome would look like, I thought it would be just a semester project. I chose to continue graLola because of the feedback I received from classmates, teachers, customers, etc. And I was seeing a ton of growth from the company! I created an LLC to make the company mine. When I made the LLC I realised I can do whatever I want with this and can take off if I want. This thought made me continue graLola for the money and the learning experience.

graLola is a great example of project based learning at The Delta School because everything I have learned throughout graLola has been a project! I was never handed something to do for graLola unless it was my decision or something that would benefit the profit of graLola. I learned a lot of math that is beneficial to running a small business and I can use that in the future. This project has also taught me that I could live off of graLola in the future if I wanted! I think learning ways to make money in the future is very important at school.

Some of the skills I have learned throughout this are:

* Marketing
* Accounting
* Getting out of my comfort zone

This project has by far made me get out of my comfort zone the most. I have talked to many people I wouldn’t talk to unless Ms. Cowdery pushed me too. I have talked to store owners, companies over the phone, CEOs of businesses, and random people to buy my graLola! I think this skill will benefit me the most in the future because where are you going to get if you can't talk to people?

graLola will benefit me in the future because I will be better at communication, having confidence in what i’m saying, and knowing I can live financially off of a product I make if I decide to take graLola that direction.
