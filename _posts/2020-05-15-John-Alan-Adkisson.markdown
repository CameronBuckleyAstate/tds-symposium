# Delta Custom Woodworking
Throughout the year, I’ve mainly focused on the entrepreneurship project. During this project, a couple of my classmates and I decided to create an LLC (Limited Liability Company) called Delta Custom Woodworking (DCW). There were a couple of different roles that needed to be done. I took in the financial role and managed how the money would be spent and how the money would be made. One thing I had to do in that role was to make a bank/checking account so that I could keep track of what and how the money was being spent. The reason that I was the financial person was that I was really the only one with the experience in that area, and because I knew what needed to be done in order for the business to keep running. This project was something that I’ll look back to in the years to come. Since I will use this skill in the near future. I've learned many new skills throughout this project, one of those skills being, I learned how to incorporate different formulas for Google Sheets to make things easier. Another thing I learned how to do was a cost per unit on an item that is for sale.
