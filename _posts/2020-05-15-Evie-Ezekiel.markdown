# Freelance Graphic Design
I wanted to use the skills I learned while working on my past project which was App Design. So I decided to begin freelancing. I would offer to create graphics or designs for my classmates and teachers.
My role was to create multiple designs that would be used for my classmate's projects, they would give me feedback that I would use to make revisions of my designs.
I never got tired of making graphics, logos, icons, and flyers. There would be something new for me to create everyday. I could see my growth overtime which was really rewarding. I liked that my classmates were interested in my work, their engagement made the project even better.
I spent most of my time working for a client, I would interview them and learn about what they wanted in a design. My project required me to display a lot of empathy while designing for my clients.
If I ever need to design myself or an employer a graphic or flyer in the future I would have the experience to know where to start.
I learned empathy, and fast prototyping skills. I would always finish my designs ,but if my client didn’t like them I would quickly move on to a new design with the feedback they gave me in mind.

## Bethany's Junior Project icons
For Bethany’s project she decided to create an app. The theme of the app was Murder Myestery and she need me to design her an icon for the app using the color pallete she chose. I had already made her a flyer for the app, so I decided to incorporate similar visuals. The main weapon of the app was guns so I decided to make the icon look like a gun firing off. The colors of the icon were a dark blue, deep red, light pink, and a darker shade of pink. My first prototype was good, but after a while of looking at it I decided to switch around the colors. Then Bethany chose to change the theme of her app to The Spanish Flu so she needed a new icon. I was asked to use the same color palette but change the gun to a facemask. The first one I made included red eyes and a mask, but I soon removed the eyes and added crease lines in the mask. I also was able to make a GIF of the gun icon using Photoshop.

## Entrepreneurship
I worked with four different businesses Purely Delta/Fizzies, graLola, and Delta Custom Woodworking. I made GIFs and logos for these businesses. I will be showing my favorites from each business.
For Purely Delta they wanted a very natural, earthy, and simple feel to their branding. After a long time of creating logos for them they decided to keep their original logo, but they did like the stickers I designed for their packaging. The stickers featured cotton bowls and the words simple, pure, handcrafted. I also created a short GIF for them to use for advertising.

For Fizzies I also designed some stickers for them to use as packaging. Fizzies is owned by Purely Delta, but has an entirely different vibe. Fizzies is a more playful and colorful brand. The stickers are designed to look like bath bubbles with the business’s name on them. I decided to make the main colors pastels.

For graLola I made a GIF for the owner Lola Sawyer to post on social media as advertising. The GIF is meant to bring attention to the play on words of the business's name graLola granola.

For Delta Custom Woodworking they gave me a drawing of what they wanted the logo to look like and after a bunch of revisions they decided on the perfect logo for their business.

## Delta School Clubs
So far I have worked with two school clubs Robotics Club and Fitness Club. I needed to work with the leaders of the clubs to create logos.
Robotics Club needed a logo that was colorful, whimsical, friendly, and should be compatible with younger students. So I created this cute colorful little robot act as the club's “mascot”. I also decided to make a GIF of the tiny robot’s light blinking.

For the Fitness club I made two different logos that could be used as a pair. One features a kettlebell with a blue background and the other has a dumbbell with a pink background.
