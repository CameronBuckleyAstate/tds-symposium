# StartEd Up
First we paired with Don Wettrick the leader of STARTedUP. We quickly noticed we wanted to help him extend his organization to Wilson. In each chapter Wednesday pitches and a Hackathon are hosted. Our group decided if we wanted to be an official chapter we should tackle a Hackathon. This event is a space for highschool students to come together. With using an entrepreneurial way of thinking, come up with solutions for problems in their community. For this to take place our group decided a leader should be picked. Wanting to challenge myself I asked to be in this position. With using organization, facilitation, and verbalizing I lead our group towards the final product of a Hackathon. The way we focused on the human-centered design value of our school was by researching. We wanted to know what is a struggle that is in our community after realizing we are in a rural food desert we knew that it would best focus on that value. I am aiming to become an Architect so this leading, organizing, and verbalizing is a huge help to working with a team. As said before I feel I have advanced in leading, organizing, and verbalizing in the view of a team. I learned that you have to be patient, rewarding, and aware in a group. While working with groups these will each help the team work together and strive to achieve more.

# Outdoor Garden Classroom
In this pickup project, I worked with the school's garden teachers to design a new structure for our garden. Using a program called Sketchup, I created multiple renditions of outdoor classrooms for the teachers to look at and give feedback to. Overall with making sketches, researching and designing I was the “Architect” of the group. This structure is for students outside working. With the heat and a lack of shade this classroom would provide work stations, shade, and water as they enjoy the outside. Therefore this project focuses on our own students. Since I want to become an Architect, even in the early stages, this project is a huge advancement for me. Experiencing designing, feedback, and the to come construction is a path to success in the field. While working on this project I realized I started to better verbilis my ideas, draft, use a computer program, and take information and then produce an outcome. The information that I picked up was better skills with Sketchup, what it means to have a client in need of a structure, and the steps it takes to be an architect. With these experiences, I can use them towards passion projects of my own, helping others in need of a space or object, or take contracts for others. May that be building a house for others, creating a local solution that addresses a problem, or making more progress for myself in the ways of designing and skill based levels.
