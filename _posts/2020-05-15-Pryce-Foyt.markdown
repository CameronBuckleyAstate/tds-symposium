# StartEd Up
StartedUp puts on events called Hackathons. These events are a space for highschool students to come together, and foster an entrepreneurial way of thinking to come up with solutions for problems in their community. For this to take place our group decided a leader should be picked. Wanting to challenge myself, I asked to be in this position. Using organization, facilitation, and verbalizing I lead our group towards the final product of a Hackathon. The way we focused on the human-centered design value of our school was by researching and empathizing. We wanted to find a struggle that is in our community. One issue brought to our attention is that we are in a rural food desert. We thought this topic would be great to focus on. I am aiming to become an architect so this leading, organizing, and verbalizing helped me advance my skills in working with a team. I learned that you have to be patient, rewarding, and aware in a group to help the team work together and strive to achieve more.

# Outdoor Garden Classroom
In this optional project, I worked with the school’s garden teachers to design a new structure for our garden. Using a program called Sketchup, I created multiple renditions of outdoor classrooms for the teachers to look at and give feedback to. I was the “Architect” of the group making sketches, researching, and designing. This structure is for student’s outside working. With the heat and a lack of shade this class pavilion would provide work stations, shade, and water as they enjoy the outside. Therefore, this project focuses on our own students. Since I want to become an architect, even in the early stages, this project was a huge advancement for me. Experiencing design, feedback, and the to come construction is a path to success in the field. While working on this project, I realized I started to better verbalize my ideas, draft, use a computer program, take information, and then produce an outcome. I picked up better skills in Sketchup, collaborating with a client in need of a structure, and the steps it takes to be an architect. I can use these experiences towards passion projects of my own, helping others in need of a space or object, or take contracts for others. May that be building a house for others, creating a local solution that addresses a problem, or making more progress for myself in the ways of designing and skill based techniques.
