# Fizzies
In this project I participated in more of the behind the scenes aspects. I created the labels, packaging, and flyers for the fizzies. Basically I was the marketer. Being the marketer was exciting for me. I found a passion through playing with different colors and fonts, seeing what fits and what doesnâ€™t fit. I learned how to list ingredients correctly, keep inventory, and how to keep up with sales. My love for creating logos and labels flowed into my next project where I made multiple flyers. Overall the things that I learned helped me to stay organized and to put my best foot forward.


#StartEd Up
In this project I was the event organizer/planner for an event we were hosting. I found a space to have the event, made the day schedule, created the flyer, and also successfully created a partnership for the event. I learned how to communicate with other businesses, how to work as a team, and how to problem solve when tough challenges occur. I will definitely need those problem solving skills in the future.
