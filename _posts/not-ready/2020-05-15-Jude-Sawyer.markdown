# Ceramics Turnrow
This year Mr.Faulkner taught me the whole process of making pottery piece on a wheel. This was a very engaging project as I took an hour out of everyday to practice. After I learned how to setup the clay on the wheel I learned so much from there. How to make a bowl, to cups with handle, plates, and even combining piece to form a sculpture. After the pieces are fired in a kiln you can put glaze on them, itâ€™s basically paint for pottery. Then you have to fire the pieces one more time for their finished look. What makes this project based learning is the skills I learned and the challenges that I faced. For future endeavors pottery could be me doing it for fun or as a career.
