# Purely Delta
I was the other half of the team that is behind Purely Delta. Purely Delta started out as an idea of how we might be able to bring a business to Wilson, Arkansas and keep it there. Purely is a soap making business and all the soap is homemade which is what makes it so unique to this area.
I was mostly over production and sales. I was doing a lot of the research into what essential oils we could use for the soap, how the recipes could vary, and ways for us to be able to get the most of the materials that we use to make the soap. I also kept track of the money that was coming and where that money was going to go. The spreadsheet that we used was updated everyday to ensure that we never had a hiccup when it came to money.
I decided that Purely Delta was the way to go because it was something that Wilson had never seen in this way before. I wanted to do something that energized me enough to continue doing it and Purely Delta was that thing. It allowed me to use skills that I already had and learn many more new skills. One of the things that really holds Purely Delta together is collaboration. While working on Purely Delta, I realized that it wouldn't be what it is if I didnâ€™t work with my business partner. We both recognized that we each have different sets of skills. Together, those skills helped us to grow Purely Delta.
