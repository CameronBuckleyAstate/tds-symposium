# Trashion Mural
For one of my projects, I made a disassemblable mural to be used as a backdrop/doorway for the next trashion show. If you don’t know, the trashion show is a runway show where the clothing being shown is made entirely from recycled materials. It was made using acrylic paints on cardboard, and stands at over eleven feet tall when assembled.
This project was a good lesson in grit. This is likely the largest scale piece of art I’ve created, and it was very difficult to be able to tough it out to the end. I had lots of struggles with the ways that the panels interacted, but through lots of trial and error, and a semi-reliable grid system, I was able to make it work.
