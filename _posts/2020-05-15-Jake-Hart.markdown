# StartEd Up
In this project I was supposed to make and publish an app for an event we were hosting. The app consisted of a schedule, overview, descriptions of the event, and photos and video of previous events similar. I chose to make an app because the previous semester I took the app design project. I used human centered design throughout this project by looking at how desirable certain features of my app were. This project can help me in the future if I ever decide to do any kinds of virtual design. In this project I mostly learned about designing apps, using specific color palettes, correct placement for pictures and text, and how to design certain features.

# Basketball Turnrow
In this turnrow Iâ€™ve been making weekly basketball videos for mainly the younger students at my school. I am the only one in this project, so I record, edit, and voice over all the videos myself. With that I have learned how to record, edit, and voice over videos for this project. I really like filming the videos, so that could come in handy if I decide to be a filmmaker. I decided to do this turnrow because I really liked teaching the younger kids on our basketball team things that I know that they didn't, and seeing them get better using what I showed and what I hope these videos do for others as well.
